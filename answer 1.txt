Dimensionality reduction is basically a way to represent high dimensional data in lesser dimensions.
High dimensional data is difficult to work with, analyse, visualize and store. In a lot of cases
the data has redundancy along some dimensions or it can be represented as a combination of multiple dimensions. 
Even dimensions hoften have correlations amongst them.
This is what is taken advantage of to reduce the dimensionality.
It is simply a compressing technique.
