Dimensionality reduction is basically a way to represent high dimensional data in lesser dimensions.
High dimensional data is difficult to work with, analyse, visualize and store. Working with High-dimensional 
representations of data leads to a very complex model which also leads to overfitting.
In a lot of cases the data has redundancy along some dimensions or it can be represented as a combination of 
multiple dimensions. Even dimensions often have correlations amongst them.
These features enable us to reduce the dimensionality.
It is basically a compressing technique.
The dimensionality is reduced in such a way so that there is no loss of information.

There are various ways to reduce dimensions.
One is feature selection and one is feature extraction.
In feature selection, we try to find a subset of the original set of features.
In feature extraction, we usually focus on combining different features to reduce the dimensionality.

One famous method for dimension reduction is PCA, where the idea of the variance of data being highest in the
lower dimension is leveraged to map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimension.
