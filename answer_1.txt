Dimensionality reduction is basically a way to represent high dimensional data in lesser dimensions.
High dimensional data is difficult to work with, analyse, visualize and store. Working with High-dimensional 
representations of data leads to a very complex model which also leads to overfitting.
In a lot of cases the data has redundancy along some dimensions or it can be represented as a combination of 
multiple dimensions. Even dimensions often have correlations amongst them.
These features enable us to reduce the dimensionality.
It is basically a compressing technique.
The dimensionality is reduced in such a way so that there is no loss of information.
